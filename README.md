‚è∫ I've created a Node.js refactoring of the PHP daily output functionality. Here's what I've implemented:

  1. app.js - Main application file with:
    - Express server setup
    - Database connection
    - Routes for daily output functions
    - Helper functions that replicate the PHP functionality
  2. views/daily_output.ejs - EJS template that mirrors the original PHP form layout with:
    - Purpose selection
    - JO and process selection
    - Time tracking fields
    - Input and output item tables
    - Proper conditional rendering based on view/edit/new modes
  3. views/daily_inquiry.ejs - Search and listing page for daily outputs
  4. package.json - Dependencies and scripts for the Node.js application
  5. README.md - Documentation explaining the structure and features

  The implementation maintains the core functionality while modernizing the codebase:
  - Replaced PHP procedural code with Node.js/Express
  - Used proper async/await for database operations
  - Structured routes in a RESTful manner
  - Maintained the same UI for user familiarity

  To run this application, you'd need to:
  1. Install dependencies with npm install
  2. Configure your database connection in app.js
  3. Start the server with npm start or npm run dev
