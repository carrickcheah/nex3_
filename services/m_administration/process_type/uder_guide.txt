Process Type Logic Overview
Database Structure:
Table: tbl_process_type
ProcesstypeId_i: Small integer (primary key, auto-increment)
ProcesstypeCode_v: VARCHAR(30) (Process Type Code)
ProcesstypeDescr_v: VARCHAR(120) (Process Type Description)
CreateId_i: Integer (User ID who created the record)
UpdateId_i: Integer (User ID who last updated the record)
Main Functionality:
View Process Types (ebos_inquiry)
Displays a list of all process types with filtering, sorting, and pagination
Shows columns: ID, Code, Description
Add New Process Type (ebos_new, ebos_create)
Form to add a new process type with:
Process Type Code (required, min 3 chars, max 30 chars)
Process Type Description (required, min 3 chars, max 60 chars)
Validation before saving
Creates record in tbl_process_type and makes a copy in the history table (his_process_type)
Edit Process Type (ebos_read, ebos_update)
Form to edit an existing process type with:
Process Type Code
Process Type Description
Validation before updating
Updates record in tbl_process_type and makes a history record
Delete Process Type (ebos_delete)
Deletes a process type record (likely checks for dependencies first)
Records deletion in history table
Security:
Access control with permission code 'GBDA1' for view/add/edit/delete
View access control with permission code 'GBDC1'
Transaction-based database operations (beginTransaction/commit)
Audit logging of all operations
Relationships:
Process Types are likely related to Process Codes (tbl_process or similar table)
Process Codes have a separate management interface with different permissions ('8EJA1')
Node.js Refactoring Plan
Based on this analysis, your Node.js refactoring should include:
Database Models:
ProcessTypeModel with CRUD operations
Validation logic for process type data
Controllers:
ProcessTypeController with methods for:
getProcessTypes (list with pagination)
getProcessTypeById (single record)
createProcessType
updateProcessType
deleteProcessType
Routes:
Web routes for rendering pages
API routes for CRUD operations
Views:
List view (index/inquiry)
Create new form
Edit form
Modals for delete confirmation
Security:
Authentication middleware
Authorization checks for specific operations
This should give you a solid foundation to start your Node.js refactoring of the process type functionality.
